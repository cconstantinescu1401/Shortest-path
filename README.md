# Shortest-path
The program involved finding the shortest path between two points and the time it takes, considering that a fictional company which makes car navigation systems asked for such program. For the implementation, I decided to use the Dijkstra algorithm.
The company provides a street map, traffic information, traffic restrictions and the vehicle driven by the customer. Java was the programming language used for the implementation.
